                            <p>Для меня Zune - это в первую очередь способ залить видео и музыку на свой Nokia Lumia. Hello, so I plugged in my 30 gig into charge and manage my music. Everything was going fine at first, but as I was installing the music it stopped and I started to get the tone from my PC of a device connecting and disconnecting repeatedly. It is now telling me; "To start, update the Zune software on your PC ay www.zune.net/setup". I'm not very software savvy Темы для Windows 7.

So here is my question. Is the zune software a humongous pile of steaming shit? I just signed up for zune pass which I like so far. I downloaded some albums on my phone. Before plugging my phone into my computer I changed the default save location of music to another drive I have in my computer. I then plugged in the phone and it removed all of the songs on my phone, then it had an error with the DRM on my computer which I eventually got fixed.

I like to watch a lot of news and news/politics/commentary shows, it's one of the only things holding me back from cutting the cord. For the past two weeks I've tried to watch no cable, and just use the internet, as a test before cancelling my cable, and have been pretty successful. I've found video podcasts are a good alternative and I don't mind watching the show the next day (since they usually aren't available immediately), but I haven't figured out a good system for automating the process.

hey, for last couple years i was digging into what artists Microsoft hired for zune originals art, ads and so on, and lately i found out zune-arts.net, on archive (https://web.archive.org/web/20061210103330/https://www.zune-arts.net/).org i can see what site was and it seems like there were tons of walls available for download (zune/desktop), but web-archive didn't cache them because they weren't hosted on this site. i found one rapidshare link on some zune forum, but obviously it's dead. Hi, First of all, I want to thank Jazzfan80, TheEvilLightBulb, Ferrango, LEK09-03, mcKaskie, and any other users who have helped in this thread. This is a guide that I basically took from Jazzfan80’s post and updated it so that other users get clearer instructions with the updated answers/replies from his post. In this post I will cover the way I was able to update my Zune firmware (one is easier than the other, thanks to mcKaskie) and I have confirmed that both of these steps first of all, open this image ( in a new tab - it'll be easier to follow. I'm pretty pissed by windows10 for phones, specifically the application design assumptions/guidelines and decided to share my thoughts about it. the hamburger menu (three bars) is one of the worst things I've met in usability of mobile applications and navigation systems in general (if it's connected to the drawer/panel menu sliding from the left side of the menu it's already a disaster. I'll try to keep this short as my English is not great (it's my second language), but I felt I had to write something about this. Context is important, that is to say, it is important to look at history and try to see why things happened, and not repeat the same mistakes again. I have seen a lot of coverage about Sinofsky's departure that has been very biased. It's pretty clear that bloggers and certainly the Technorati did not like Sinofsky at all.

Howdy! I'm building a PC for the first time, but I'm not too fond of the vast majority of cases I've seen out there--they all tend to look either like ostentatious battleships, or boring plain air conditioning units. So I need some help looking for an attractive case, one that isn't super-boxy, but also isn't super-ornate. My first choice was the Thermaltake Versa N21 ( which I fell in love with immediately because of its unique. I am at work and checked my email and saw that 2 point purchases were made to my Xbox live account no more than 30 minutes ago. They had bought the points threw the Zune site. There was also a second email added to my account. I check my bank account and sure enough the charges went through. I then logged on to billing.microsoft.com and helplessly watched as the points were spent on PREMIUM GOLD PACK's, the worst part is I was watching live as the transactions went through one after another.

I'll send pictures if requested and I'm more than happy to negotiate a price/item, no matter how small. The Images included are from google images.

So, I hate to troll and post just to further escalate the resolution feud. However, let's be honest there is a little fan boy in us all, but more importantly here is some info I have found regarding the new COD title. After many have tested the trailer for Advanced Warfare taken from the Xbox One it was discovered that the resolution actually hovered around 810p-840p.

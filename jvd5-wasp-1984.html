Firstly, I want to profusely apologize for the lateness of these results when I had promised them several months ago. It is entirely on me. However, I'd like to think of this as a huge learning experience for myself, so as not to make the same mistakes in ~~next~~ this year's survey. I put too much focus on the graphics I was making for the survey results, but at this point, I'm just too busy and I don't want to keep these results away from you folks just because they're not accompanied.

I’ve been doing some research into the first Resident Evil game and the 2002 remake, and I’ve discovered a crazy number of connections to older horror and thriller movies. I was looking for cinematic influences on the game and found a magazine in Japanese released 2 days before Resident Evil 2 came out in the 90’s called “Biohazard 2 – Prologue to Terror”. I had someone translate the titles in the section about the monsters from the first game and the links blew my mind.

Now that Gunn is back with Marvel, I'm finally back to feeling excited about what's coming next and to start speculating again. Now with the Fox acquisition in 5 days, and Engame coming out in less than two months, a lot could change, but as far as we can tell, this is what's coming up for Marvel Studios (the dates are my best guess): #Cinema ##Confirmed 2019, July 5: Spider-Man: Far From Home , Jon Watts directing 2020, May 1 or July 31: Black Widow , Cate Shortland directing. So I was doing a review for a school project pulling up a complete list of studio super-hero movies. I completed the list and realized that there were exactly 100 entries. So I thought it would post the data I compiled here for everyone's enjoyment. (obviously, the number will changed depending on how you define a super-hero movie, the genre line is somewhat subjective, but I used my best judgment to narrow it down, and I ruled out parodies. This also only contains movies that were released. I try my best to respond to all offers. If not, either life got in the way or I'm thinking about an offer, apologies if I am not able to respond. Always on the lookout to add to my collection with older titles but I may have most common ones already. Please list what you want, don’t just link to your list.

Since she's a new ward, not much of the nuance is known as of yet. From her appearances so far, it's apparent she's intensely shy, and doesn't like interacting with media.

There were a few days I had to get creative only in terms of limitations of what my day brought about- whether it be a day where I attended say Comic-Con.
